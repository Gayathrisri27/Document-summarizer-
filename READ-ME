DESCRIPTION:

This Python code provides a function summarize_document to summarize a given document using the facebook/bart-large-cnn model from the transformers library. It handles the summarization of long documents by splitting them into chunks and summarizing each chunk individually before combining the results into a final summary. Below is an elaboration of how each part of the code works:

1. Imports and Model Setup
python
Copy code
import nltk
from transformers import pipeline
nltk: Used for natural language processing, specifically to split the input text into sentences using the punkt tokenizer.
transformers: The pipeline from the Hugging Face Transformers library is used to access the pre-trained BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model for summarization.
2. Summarize Function Definition
python
Copy code
def summarize_document(text, max_length=150):
The function summarize_document accepts two parameters:
text: The document to summarize.
max_length: The maximum length of each chunk's summary. The default value is set to 150.
3. Downloading Required NLTK Data
python
Copy code
nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)
The NLTK punkt tokenizer is downloaded (if not already available), which will be used for splitting the input text into sentences.
4. Initializing the Summarization Model
python
Copy code
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
A summarization pipeline is created using the BART model (facebook/bart-large-cnn). This model is fine-tuned for summarization tasks, making it ideal for condensing large amounts of text into a summary.
5. Splitting Text into Sentences
python
Copy code
sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)
The input text is split into individual sentences using the NLTK sent_tokenize function, which helps in breaking the text into smaller chunks.
6. Chunking the Document
python
Copy code
chunks = []
current_chunk = ""
for sentence in sentences:
    if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence) < 1000:
        current_chunk += " " + sentence
    else:
        chunks.append(current_chunk.strip())
        current_chunk = sentence
if current_chunk:
    chunks.append(current_chunk.strip())
The document is split into chunks, where each chunk contains up to 1000 characters. This is necessary because the BART model has a limit on the input length it can process. Sentences are grouped together until they approach this limit, after which they are added as a chunk.
7. Summarizing Each Chunk
python
Copy code
summaries = []
for chunk in chunks:
    summary = summarizer(chunk, max_length=max_length, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
    summaries.append(summary[0]['summary_text'])
Each chunk is passed through the summarizer pipeline, which generates a summary for that chunk.
max_length: Controls the maximum number of tokens in the summary.
min_length: Ensures a minimum length of 30 tokens for each summary.
do_sample=False: Disables randomness, ensuring that the model provides deterministic output.
The generated summary is extracted and added to the summaries list.
8. Combining the Summaries
python
Copy code
final_summary = " ".join(summaries)
The individual summaries from all chunks are combined into a single final_summary string.
9. Returning the Final Summary
python
Copy code
return final_summary
The function returns the final summary.
10. Example Usage
python
Copy code

An example document about Accenture is provided, which is used for testing the summarization.
11. Summary Generation and Output
python
Copy code
summary = summarize_document(document)
print("Original text length:", len(document))
print("Summary length:", len(summary))
print("\nSummary:")
print(summary)
The summarize_document function is called with the example document.
The original and summary text lengths are printed, followed by the summary itself.
